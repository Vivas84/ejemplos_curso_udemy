## Vagrant

For the config of the environment, I used the guide in (I)
The vagrant file just creates a couple of Ubuntu VMs.
For the deployment of those VMs, I needed a provider that works on Apple arm64 architecture. Therefore I had to use VMware Fusion with a license for personal use.
For the integration of Vagrant and the VMWare Fusion with the plugin, I used the software package vagrant-vmware-utility_1.0.22_darwin_amd64.dmg
